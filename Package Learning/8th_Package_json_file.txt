What does package.json file consist of?
    The package.json file contains the metadata information. This metadata information in package.json file can be categorized into below categories.

1) Identifying metadata properties :-   It basically consist of the properties to identify the module/project such as the name 
                                        of the project, current version of the module, license, author of the project,
                                        description about the project etc.
2) Functional metadata properties :-    As the name suggests, it consists of the functional values/properties of the
                                        project/module such as the entry/starting point of the module, dependencies in 
                                        project, scripts being used, repository links of Node project etc.





Create a package.json file :- A package.json file can be created in two ways.

1) Using npm init :-    Running this command, system expects user to fill the vital information required as discussed above.
                        It provides users with default values which are editable by the user. 
Syntax :- npm init 
 
2) Writing directly to file :-  One can directly write into file with all the required information and can include it in the
                                Node project.



Note :- 
1) Package.json is used to track libraries and its version used in our project
2) package.json-lock contains metadata of dependencies.

3) Node.js is Single-Threaded :- Means it works on one task at a time.
